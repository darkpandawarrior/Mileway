/**
 * PLAN_V22 P6.8: a single "Video Tutorials" card on `HelpScreen` — Mileway's own local equivalent
 * of a reference-app video-tutorial library, minus any bundled video asset or codec dependency
 * (no `Media3`/`ExoPlayer` in this app's dependency graph yet, and pulling one in for a demo-data
 * feature would be exactly the kind of unnecessary dependency CLAUDE.md's guardrails call out).
 * [durationLabel] is the card's static runtime readout; actual "playback" is a locally simulated
 * progress state (see `VideoTutorialPlaybackState` in `HelpScreen.kt`), not a real video stream.
