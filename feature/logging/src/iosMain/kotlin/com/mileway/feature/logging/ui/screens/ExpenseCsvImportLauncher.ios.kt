 * iOS actual: no native document-picker UI hook exists yet from a `ComposeUIViewController` host
 * (same documented gap as [rememberReceiptAttachmentLauncher] and `core/platform`'s
 * `IosDocumentScanner` — presenting a `UIDocumentPickerViewController` needs a live
 * `UIViewController` to present from, which isn't wired here). Returns a callback that is a
 * truthful no-op — [onPicked] is never invoked — rather than a fragile stand-in.
