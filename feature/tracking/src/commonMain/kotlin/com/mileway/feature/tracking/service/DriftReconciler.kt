/**
 * Wave-2: every [RECONCILE_INTERVAL_MS] (120s), compares the in-memory point count against the
 * DB truth (`LocationDao.countLocationsByToken`, wired at the call site) and reports whether a
 * correction is needed. Batched writes ([LocationBatcher]) mean the in-memory counter can run
 * briefly ahead of what's actually landed in Room — this is the periodic safety net, distinct
 * from [CounterReconcilePolicy]'s one-shot resume/pause reconciliation.
 *
 * Pure decision logic: the caller supplies the current time and both counts, and applies the
 * correction (there's no DB/session dependency here — reuses [CounterReconcilePolicy] for the
 * comparison itself).
