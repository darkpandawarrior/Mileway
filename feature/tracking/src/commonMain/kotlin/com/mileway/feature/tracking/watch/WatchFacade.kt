 * fields the watch never shows), so it stays cheap over DataLayer/WCSession later if trip lists are

 * The single facade both watch UIs (Wear OS Compose, and — via the headless KMP framework — Swift/
 * watchOS) bind to. Deliberately thin: it delegates to the phone's EXISTING [SnapshotPublisher] (the
 * already-shared, already-tested [SurfaceSnapshot] channel — see `core:data`'s `SnapshotPublisher.kt`),
 * [SavedTrackRepository] (read-only here) and [TrackingController] (start/stop), and exposes nothing
 * but plain value types across its public API.
 *
 * Lives in `feature:tracking` (not `core:data`, despite the plan's original file hint) because both
 * of its non-snapshot dependencies — [SavedTrackRepository] and [TrackingController] — are
 * `feature:tracking` types; `core:data` cannot depend on a feature module (feature modules depend on
 * `core:*`, never the reverse — see CLAUDE.md "Architecture discipline"). `:wear` already depends on
 * `feature:tracking` (P2.1), so this is the correct, boundary-respecting home for the seam.
