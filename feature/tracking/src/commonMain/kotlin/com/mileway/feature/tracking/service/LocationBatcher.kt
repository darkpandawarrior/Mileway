/**
 * Wave-2 batching: buffers points in memory and writes them to Room via
 * [LocationRepository.insertBatch] instead of one `insert` per GPS fix — cuts IO/battery.
 *
 * Flushes when the buffer reaches [MAX_BATCH_SIZE] points, or when [MAX_BATCH_AGE_MS] has
 * elapsed since the last flush, whichever comes first. [flush] forces an out-of-band flush and
 * MUST be called on every lifecycle transition that could precede process death (stop, pause,
 * service teardown) — see LocationTrackingService call sites — so a clean stop/pause never loses
 * buffered points. A crash can still lose the current in-flight window; that's the accepted
 * tradeoff (parity spec §2.2).
 *
 * [now] is injected so tests can drive the 30s window with a fake clock.
