# Mileway

### Offline-first mileage, travel and expense tracking, built in Kotlin and Compose Multiplatform.

A standalone, fully offline app. It puts the location-engineering, offline-first and
multi-module architecture I care about into one place you can actually run.
Every screen draws from deterministic mock data, so there are zero backend calls.

## Why Mileway

Mileway is a self-contained, offline-first mileage tracker. The whole thing runs in airplane mode:
you track trips, log expenses, route approvals, and the data is still there after a restart. No
tracked code reaches for the network.

I also use it as a reference for how I build Android and KMP apps. That means Compose Multiplatform,
a multi-module clean architecture across 27 Gradle modules, MVI-style unidirectional state, Koin for
DI, Room (KMP) with DataStore, and a `gms`/`noGms` flavor split so the same code ships to both the
Play Store and F-Droid.

## Highlights

- 🛰️ **Real location engineering.** The tracking pipeline fights GPS jitter and recovers from spikes,
  with spike detection, four-bucket distance accounting and IMU fusion.
- 📴 **Genuinely offline.** No backend URLs, no API keys, no network calls in tracked code. It runs in
  airplane mode and keeps its state in Room and DataStore.
- 🧩 **27-module clean architecture.** Feature modules never touch each other. They meet only at the
  `:app` composition root, wired through Koin.
- 🌍 **Kotlin Multiplatform — iOS live (V19).** All feature screens run on Android *and* iOS from
  `commonMain`. Background scheduling uses [kmpworkmanager](https://github.com/brewkits/kmpworkmanager)
  (BGTask dispatcher + AppDelegate); platform services sit behind `expect`/`actual`.
- 🔀 **One codebase, two distributions.** A `gms` Play build and a FOSS `noGms` / F-Droid build, with
  a dependency-prefix guard that fails the build the moment a proprietary library leaks into FOSS.
- 🧪 **Quality gates in CI.** 131 Roborazzi/host-rendered screenshot tests on the JVM (no emulator,
  no network), Napier structured logging, detekt, ktlint and Kover, plus reproducible F-Droid
  release workflows.
- 🔥 **Ember theme, four platforms from one KMP core.** A warm amber/red dark theme (replacing an
  earlier phosphor-green look) skins Android/iOS phone, Wear OS, watchOS and Compose Desktop — all
  from the same `commonMain` architecture.

## Screenshots

#### Wear OS

The watch app shares `commonMain`'s `SurfaceSnapshot`/`WearPresentation` mapping with the phone,
skinned with the same Ember accent via `WearMilewayTheme` (`androidx.wear.compose.material3`, its
own design system — never the phone/iOS CMP theming module). Host-rendered with Roborazzi, no
watch emulator needed.

| ![Wear OS dashboard with today/week distance cards and week-goal ring](docs/screenshots/wear_dashboard.png) | ![Wear OS recent-trips list](docs/screenshots/wear_trip_list.png) |

#### Compose Desktop

A thin Compose Desktop window over the same shared `core:{data,ui}` dashboard model as the phone
and watch — no `feature:tracking`/Room repository, fixed mock trips instead (a deliberate sequencing
choice, not a permanent one). Rendered host-side with Compose Multiplatform's
`runDesktopComposeUiTest`, no windowing system required.

| &nbsp; |
|:---:|
| ![Compose Desktop dashboard window with today/week stats and a recent-trips list](docs/screenshots/desktop_dashboard.png) |

#### Widgets

**Android home-screen widget (Glance).** Renders the shared `SurfaceSnapshot` — today/week distance
plus a red "Tracking now" live indicator — host-rendered with Roborazzi over the `GlanceAppWidget`,
no launcher or emulator needed.

| &nbsp; |
|:---:|
| ![Android Glance home-screen widget with today/week distance and a red live-tracking indicator](docs/screenshots/widget_glance.png) |

**iOS WidgetKit.** Home-screen + Lock Screen widgets over the same shared snapshot (App-Group
store), with an interactive App-Intent Start/Stop button — SwiftUI `ImageRenderer`, no home-screen
placement needed.

| Home widget | Lock Screen |
|:---:|:---:|
| ![iOS home-screen widget with today/week distance and a Stop button](docs/screenshots/widget_ios_home.png) | ![iOS Lock Screen accessory widget with today's distance](docs/screenshots/widget_ios_lockscreen.png) |

#### watchOS app

Native SwiftUI over the `:sharedWatch` KMP framework — today/week distance, a red live-tracking
pill, and a trips drill-down. Host-rendered on the watchOS simulator via SwiftUI `ImageRenderer`.

| &nbsp; |
|:---:|
| ![watchOS dashboard with amber distance, red Tracking pill and a Trips button](docs/screenshots/watchos_app.png) |

#### Live Activity & Dynamic Island

ActivityKit Live Activity (Lock Screen banner) + a Dynamic Island expanded presentation for an
in-progress trip, driven by the phone's `TrackingLiveActivityController`. Presentation content is
factored out of the `ActivityConfiguration` so `ImageRenderer` can host-render it.

| Lock Screen banner | Dynamic Island (expanded) |

<code>ScreenshotCatalogTest</code>. Every full screen above is recorded by <code>ScreenshotGalleryTest</code>
(phone) / <code>WearScreenshotGalleryTest</code> (watch) / a JVM `desktopTest` (desktop).</sub>

## Features

Every feature is fully interactive on mocked, offline data.

| Area | What's inside |
|---|---|
| **Tracking** | Live GPS trip tracking on a foreground service (jitter suppression, spike detection, four-bucket accounting); geofenced check-in with manual fallback; saved tracks (journey/submission tabs); trip insights; hardware-events log; GPX / CSV / KML / GeoJSON export. |
| **Logging &amp; Expenses** | Step-by-step manual trip logging; expense entry → detail → success chain. |
| **Travel** | Travel hub, active-trip card (flight / train), upcoming bookings, plus trip &amp; booking history surfaces. |
| **Approvals &amp; Payables** | Approval queue with policy-violation badges and seek-clarification sheet; payables hub, multi-step create-PR / invoice flows and history surfaces. |
| **Payments, Events &amp; Cards** | QR pay / request + history; event creation + history; card home / detail / request (KYC-lite). |
| **Profile &amp; Account** | Account hub, advance requests, Canvas-rendered analytics dashboards, an AI assistant sheet, notification centre, permission-health screen, and a MaterialKolor theme engine. |
| **Media** | CameraX capture (flash, pinch-zoom, tap-focus), on-device odometer OCR, attachment grid. |
| **Master search** | A registry-based search that fans a query across every feature module. |

## Architecture

Multi-module clean architecture. Feature modules never depend on one another; they meet only at the
`:app` composition root. State is unidirectional. Each screen exposes a single immutable state as a
`StateFlow`, collected with `collectAsStateWithLifecycle`, and a shared `ScreenState` wrapper models
the loading, empty, error and content cases.

**Key patterns**

- **commonMain-first KMP.** Core modules compile for Android and iOS (`iosArm64`,
  `iosSimulatorArm64`). Platform-bound tech (FusedLocation, CameraX, ML Kit, WorkManager,
  BiometricPrompt, the foreground service) sits behind `expect`/`actual` interfaces in `:core:platform`.
- **Koin DI.** One module per feature, and the `InitKoin()` bootstrap is re-entrancy-safe for both the
  Android `Application` and the iOS entry point.
- **SearchProvider registry.** Each feature binds a `SearchProvider` into Koin. The master-search
  aggregator resolves `getAll<SearchProvider>()` and fans out, so search and the features stay decoupled.
- **Shared scaffolds.** `FormSubmissionScaffold` and `HistoryListScaffold` standardise the create and
  history flows that travel, payables, payments and events all reuse.
- **Navigation.** Type-safe JetBrains Compose Navigation, with per-feature graphs assembled at `:app`.

| `:wear` | Wear OS app — dashboard, trip list/detail, tile, complication, ongoing activity, phone sync |
| `:sharedWatch` | Headless KMP static framework (no Compose) consumed by the native SwiftUI watchOS app |
| `:shared` | iOS umbrella framework — re-exports `core:ui`, `feature:tracking`, `feature:agent` and `feature:logging` as the single `Mileway.framework` Xcode links against |
| `:widget` | Glance home-screen widget (mileage summary + quick start/stop) |
| `:baselineprofile` | Macrobenchmark module generating the Baseline Profile via `:app:generateNoGmsReleaseBaselineProfile` |

## Getting started

```bash
git clone https://github.com/darkpandawarrior/Mileway.git
cd Mileway

# Assemble the offline-safe default build
./gradlew assembleNoGmsDebug

# Install on a device/emulator (API 30+)
adb install app/build/outputs/apk/noGms/debug/app-noGms-debug.apk
```

No network connection is required. The data is all mock and persists locally through Room and DataStore.

> **Offline check:** enable airplane mode, track a trip, kill and relaunch the app, and confirm the
> record persisted.

## Build flavors

A `maps` flavor dimension splits the app into a proprietary and a FOSS build:

| Flavor | Maps | Google / Play / Firebase | Use case |
|---|---|---|---|
| `gms` | KrossMap (Google Maps / MapKit) | Firebase + Play services | Play Store build |
| `noGms` | MapLibre + offline MBTiles (no API key) | none (FOSS-clean) | F-Droid / fully offline |

A dependency-prefix guard fails the build if proprietary libraries leak into the `noGms` classpath.

## Ralph-loop development

This repo is built and evolved almost entirely through autonomous Ralph-loop iteration
(`.ralph/PLAN.md` plus versioned plans `PLAN_V3` … `PLAN_V20`, each one migration phase — KMP
hoisting, iOS parity, the AI assistant rebuild, etc.). Progress is tracked per iteration in
`.ralph/PROGRESS.md`.

- **Verification gate (current, flavored build):**
  ```bash
  ./gradlew assembleNoGmsDebug && ./gradlew testNoGmsDebugUnitTest
  ```
  (the `gms` flavor crashes Robolectric, so unit tests only run on `noGms`.)
- **Guardrail:** the Ralph Stop hook reverts uncommitted *tracked* edits between turns — each
  iteration must edit, build/test, and commit within the same turn, or the change is lost.
- Historical note: earlier plan revisions reference the original, pre-flavor bootstrap commands
  `assembleDebug` / `testDebugUnitTest` from when this repo was a bare single-variant extraction of
  the mileage feature; those tasks are long complete and the flavored commands above are what CI
  and current Ralph runs actually use.

## Testing and quality

- **JVM unit tests.** 88 test classes covering ViewModels, repositories and feature logic with MockK
  and Turbine, run on the `noGms` flavor with no emulator.
- **Screenshot tests.** Roborazzi renders every screen across all feature modules plus the
  component-preview matrices on the JVM (`ScreenshotGalleryTest` and `ScreenshotCatalogTest`, 90+ PNGs
  in `docs/screenshots/`). They're deterministic and diff cleanly in PRs.
- **Static analysis.** detekt and ktlint across every module, with Kover for coverage.
- **CI.** `.github/workflows/ci.yml` runs `assembleGmsDebug` and `testNoGmsDebugUnitTest` on every push
  and PR. Separate `quality`, `release` and `publish-fdroid` workflows handle the gates and distribution.
- **Distribution.** Beyond Play/F-Droid/Indus (`release.yml`, `publish-fdroid.yml`, `indus-deploy.yml`):
  `amazon-appstore-deploy.yml`, `huawei-appgallery-deploy.yml`, `samsung-galaxy-store-deploy.yml`, and
  `aptoide-deploy.yml` cover the other major Android storefronts, all gated on repo secrets and inert
  until configured (see each workflow's header comment). GitHub Releases (already published by
  `release.yml`) also make the app trackable via [Obtainium](https://github.com/ImranR98/Obtainium)
  with no extra config. **Uptodown** has no public submission API — manual web-form upload only.

## Roadmap

A snapshot of where Mileway is and where it's heading. This is a portfolio/demo project, so the
roadmap reflects direction rather than commitments.

**Shipped**

- [x] Offline-first app on deterministic mock data (zero backend calls)
- [x] 27-module clean architecture with Koin DI
- [x] Compose Multiplatform UI; `commonMain` core compiles for Android + iOS
- [x] `gms` / `noGms` flavor split + FOSS dependency-prefix guard
- [x] Room (KMP) + DataStore persistence
- [x] Location engine (jitter / spike / four-bucket / IMU fusion) with a simulated drive source
- [x] Master search: a registry across feature modules with an aggregator, results screen and navigation
- [x] Roborazzi/host-rendered screenshot suite (131 images, JVM-only), detekt / ktlint / Kover, CI + release workflows
- [x] Wear OS companion tile
- [x] **iOS UI parity (V19).** All feature screens in `commonMain`; background scheduling via
      kmpworkmanager; AppDelegate + BGTask dispatcher; iOS builds and passes all CI gates.
- [x] Napier structured logging across all modules
- [x] **AI assistant / "agent" feature (V20).** Offline, retrieval-grounded chat over real local
      trip/expense/card data; Room-backed persistent history + 5-minute session resume; on-device
      voice I/O (STT/TTS); feedback, export and real-usage popular-question ranking; full
      `commonMain` + iOS parity. (A dedicated Popular/Unanswered analytics screen and persisted
      unanswered-question submission are still open — tracked as backlog.)
- [x] Matrix / terminal design-language pass across the whole UI (theme tokens, topbar, screenshots)
- [x] Renamed the project and package from MileTracker(Demo) to Mileway end-to-end
- [x] **Multi-account depth (V22).** Room-backed multi-persona account store with a real
      switch-account mechanism, PIN/biometric gate, and per-account session isolation (trip/expense
      queries re-scoped, cross-persona cold-start reconciliation).
- [x] **Profile / Settings depth (V22).** Room-backed approval delegation, a full Active Sessions
      screen (per-device revoke), a real local Notification Centre with unread counts and channel
      toggles, connected-account integration toggles, real permission-state checks, and a local
      support-ticket flow (My Tickets) with video tutorials.
- [x] **Login / onboarding depth (V22).** Staged sign-in loading states, a demo-mode persona picker,
      an app-wide local PIN gate (set/check with biometric fallback), and a welcome disclaimer sheet
      requesting real location/notification permissions before first use.
- [x] **Watch platform build-out (V23).** Shared `SurfaceSnapshot`/`WatchSyncPayload` domain contract
      in `core:data`; a full Wear OS app (dashboard, trip list/detail, tile, complication, ongoing
      activity, phone→watch `DataClient` sync); a native SwiftUI watchOS app over the new headless
      `:sharedWatch` KMP framework with two-way `WatchConnectivity` sync; Android Glance widget +
      App Shortcuts + Quick Settings tile + AppFunctions; iOS WidgetKit widgets, Live Activity/Dynamic
      Island, and App Intents/Siri Shortcuts; an accessibility sweep across every new surface on both
      platforms.

**Exploring**

- [ ] Baseline Profiles real on-device generation (device-gated; static profile ships today)
- [ ] Instrumented (on-device) UI test tier alongside the JVM suite
- [ ] Larger bundled offline map packs
- [ ] Expand Roborazzi catalog to remaining edge-case states
- [ ] watchOS live device verification, AppFunctions ADB invocation, Siri phrase invocation — all
      compile/build-verified here, pending real-device/simulator-runtime confirmation

## iOS, Wear OS and watchOS

- **iOS.** Every `:core:*` module compiles to an iOS framework, with `expect`/`actual` services
  backed by CoreLocation, Vision (OCR), UserNotifications, LocalAuthentication and BackgroundTasks.
  A few proprietary integrations (in-app update, install-referrer) are stubbed with `TODO(ios)`
  markers, and the shared Compose UI renders through a minimal SwiftUI host. Home/Lock Screen
  WidgetKit widgets, a Live Activity/Dynamic Island for active tracking, and App Intents/Siri
  Shortcuts (start/stop/log) round out the iOS surface, all reading the same offline
  `SurfaceSnapshot`/`WatchFacade` seam as the phone app.
- **Wear OS.** `:wear` is a full Compose-for-Wear-OS app: a `ScalingLazyColumn` dashboard (today/week
  distance, tracking state, goal progress), trip list + detail, a real tile and complication backed
  by the shared snapshot, an ongoing activity wired to live tracking, and a phone→watch `DataClient`
  sync (gms flavor only; noGms stays FOSS-pure).
- **watchOS.** A native SwiftUI app (`iosApp/MilewayWatch`) over `:sharedWatch`, a headless KMP
  static framework exposing the same domain facade with no Compose/UI dependency — dashboard, trip
  list, and two-way `WatchConnectivity` sync with the iPhone app. Built via XcodeGen
  (`iosApp/project.yml`); verified with `xcodebuild`, not the Gradle gate.
- **Both watch platforms** share one commonMain contract: `SurfaceSnapshot` (trip stats) and
  `WatchSyncPayload`/`WatchSyncBridge` (the serializable phone↔watch wire format) live in
  `core:data`, so Wear's `DataClient` push and watchOS's `WatchConnectivity` session drive off the
  identical shared model — no per-platform reimplementation of the sync contract.

**Verification status by surface** (what's gate-verified here vs. pending real hardware):

| Surface | Build/compile | Automated tests | Live/device verification |
|---|---|---|---|
| Wear OS app (dashboard, trips, tile, complication, ongoing activity) | ✅ `assembleNoGmsDebug`/`assembleGmsDebug` | ✅ `testNoGmsDebugUnitTest` (incl. host-rendered Roborazzi screenshots) | ⏸ on-watch GPS verification only |
| Phone→watch DataLayer sync (gms) | ✅ compiles, FOSS-purity guard passes | ✅ unit-tested | ⏸ needs a paired physical/emulated Wear device |
| watchOS app (SwiftUI + `:sharedWatch`) | ✅ `xcodebuild … -scheme MilewayWatch build` | ✅ host-rendered screenshot (WatchScreenshotTests) | ✅ dashboard captured |
| WatchConnectivity sync (iOS ↔ watchOS) | ✅ compiles both schemes | — | ⏸ needs a live paired simulator/device session |
| Android Glance widget + quick start/stop | ✅ `assembleNoGmsDebug` | ✅ `MileageSummaryWidgetTest` | — (in-process Glance render, no home-screen manual check done here) |
| Android App Shortcuts / Quick Settings tile / AppFunctions | ✅ compiles | ✅ unit-tested | ⏸ AppFunctions invocation needs `adb shell` on an API-36 emulator (device-gated) |
| iOS WidgetKit + Live Activity/Dynamic Island | ✅ `xcodebuild -scheme MilewayWidgets build` | ✅ host-rendered screenshots (WidgetScreenshotTests) | ✅ widgets + Live Activity captured |
| iOS App Intents / Siri Shortcuts | ✅ compiles, `AppShortcutsProvider` registered | — | ⏸ Siri phrase invocation needs a device/simulator with Siri running |
| Compose Desktop dashboard | ✅ `:desktopApp:desktopMain` compiles | ✅ `desktopTest` (host-rendered screenshot) | — (pure-JVM, no separate device verification needed) |
| Accessibility sweep (Android + iOS/watchOS surfaces) | ✅ compiles | — | ⏸ manual VoiceOver/TalkBack walkthrough documented inline; no automated a11y audit target yet |

## The location engine

The tracking pipeline is built to suppress jitter and recover from GPS spikes:

- **Jitter suppression.** Stationary drift gets filtered out while the anchor point is preserved.
- **Spike detection.** An implied-speed check flags teleporting fixes instead of silently dropping them.
- **Four-bucket accounting.** `original`, `cleaned`, `abnormal` and `mock` are each persisted per track.
- **Mock-location flagging.** Spoofing is detectable, not just blocked.
- **IMU fusion.** Accelerometer and gyroscope snapshots feed the post-hoc insight analyzers.

Set `SIMULATE_LOCATION = true` and a simulated drive source feeds believable fixes through the exact
same pipeline, so the whole tracking flow works on an emulator with no GPS hardware.
