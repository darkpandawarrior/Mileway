/**
 * PLAN_V22 P6.4: a device session the demo account is signed in on — replaces
 * `stub.ProfileMockData.sessions()`'s bare in-memory list as the source of truth for
 * `ActiveSessionsScreen`'s revoke/bulk-sign-out-all-others actions, so a revoke actually persists
 * across process death instead of resetting on next launch.
 *
 * [isCurrent] marks the one row that can never be revoked (the device driving this app instance);
 * `status` (Active/Recent/Idle) is derived from [lastActiveMillis] at read time, not stored here,
 * so it never goes stale relative to "now."
