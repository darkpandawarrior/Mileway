/**
 * PLAN_V22 P7.1: today `SessionRepository.signInWithCredentials(email)` writes exactly two
 * DataStore keys (kind, email) — no profile fetch, no tenant/office/theme bootstrap, nothing
 * shaped like a real post-login response. This is the local, no-network stand-in for that:
 * shaped like the reference app's `profile/me` bootstrap response, but synthesized entirely from
 * static demo constants keyed off [MockAccountDao]'s seeded personas (P1.1) — never a network
 * call, per CLAUDE.md's "no backend, ever" rule.
 *
 * If [email] matches a seeded [com.mileway.core.data.model.db.MockAccountEntity] (by
 * [com.mileway.core.data.model.db.MockAccountEntity.employeeCode] derived the same deterministic
 * way [deriveEmployeeCode] does), that persona's `displayName`/`employeeCode`/`organization` seed
 * the profile so the synthesized identity lines up with whichever account is about to become
 * active; otherwise a deterministic fallback derived purely from [email] is used so sign-in never
 * fails just because the email wasn't one of the seeded demo personas.
