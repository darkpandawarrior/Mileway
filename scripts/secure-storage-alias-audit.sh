# PLAN_V21 P7.2: audits tracked Kotlin source for orphaned Android Keystore
# secure-storage aliases. Mileway has never adopted AndroidKeyStore/
# EncryptedSharedPreferences/security-crypto (grep the version catalog — no
# such dependency exists); all "secure" persistence today is DataStore-backed
# (PinHashStore et al. hash the PIN before it's ever written). So a "dead
# alias" here means literal residue from an earlier migration, not a runtime
# concept this app currently has any live use for.
#
# ponytail: this script IS the cleanup for P7.2 — there is no real Keystore
# alias infra in this repo to reclaim, so closing the acceptance criterion
# means proving that in a repeatable way rather than inventing fake Keystore
# code just to delete it. Upgrade path: if a future task actually introduces
# AndroidKeyStore-backed storage, this script's zero-alias assumption breaks
# on purpose (grep starts matching), which is the signal to design a real
# per-alias lifecycle/reclaim story then.
