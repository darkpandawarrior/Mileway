# Runs a JVM unit-test (or Roborazzi record) Gradle task, tolerating a KNOWN, upstream flake:
# Robolectric 4.16.1's native Skia runtime segfaults the forked test JVM on *exit* (exit value 2)
# AFTER every test has already run and passed, on JDK 21 (both Linux CI and macOS). The Gradle task
# therefore reports failure even though no test failed.
#
# The per-test JUnit XML is the source of truth here: this wrapper fails ONLY if a real
# <failure>/<error> is present, or if no XML was produced at all (tests never ran). A genuine test
# failure still fails the build; only the teardown-exit-code flake is tolerated.
#
# Follow-up to properly fix (isolate the @GraphicsMode(NATIVE) Roborazzi tests further, or bump
# Robolectric/JDK once a fixed release exists) is tracked in the repo backlog.
